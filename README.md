===========

OpenCart Xtended Edition is an unofficial fork that adds commonly used features/modules in a single package.

## Contribution Guidelines

 1. The OpenCart Xtended Edition GitHub repository is for submitting bug reports and bug fixes.  If you need assistance troubleshooting an issue with OpenCart please use the official community support forums at [forum.opencart.com](http://forum.opencart.com).
 2. When submitting a bug report please include your OpenCart version, relevant environment info, and a step-by-step process on how to create the error or the relevant line of code which causes it.  If you are unsure if an issue is a bug please post in the community support forum for assistance.
 3. When submitting a pull request leave a description of the changes so the repository maintainers can more efficiently review the code.  A pull request should only cover one issue, preferably with a single commit.
 4. Follow the existing syntax and styling used in OpenCart for all pull requests.  This helps keep code clean and readable.  You may be asked to resubmit a pull request if standard styling is not followed. 
 5. Attempt to keep changes as minimal as possible.  Significant changes to code risk causing compatibility issues with third-party mods.
 6. Significant code changes which may impact third-party mods or themes should be discussed before inclusion.
 7. If a bug is fixed in the official OpenCart repository with minimal changes that method is preferred in Xtended Edition.
 8. If applicable submit a bug report or fix to the [opencart/opencart core](https://github.com/opencart/opencart).
 9. Only submit code that you have the rights to or that is released under GPL.  Code from commercial mods or mods not explicitly released under GPL is prohibited.
 10. Pull requests and bug reports that are closed without action will include a statement why.  Feel free to advocate for re-opening the issue but please note the decision may not be reversed.  Remember, closing an issue is not meant as a personal attack against you.  It's about what's best for the project.
